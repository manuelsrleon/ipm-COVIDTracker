# ipm-COVIDTracker
This was an assignment made in academic year 21-22 as part of a subject called Interfaces Persona Máquina (user interfaces). It is the first part of a three-piece assignment which revolves around the querying, logging and searching of COVID contacts. Of course, this was done during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.   

The Hasura (GraphQL) backend was provided to us by Noelia Barreira Rodríguez (noelia.barreira@udc.es), and is publicly available on github.com/nbarreira/ipm2122-server

*Keep in mind that design considerations were secondary, as pretty UI design was hardly valued and we only had the time that was strictly necessary to comply with the non-functional requirements proposed by the teachers.
